Linear Programming-based Inverse Reinforcement Learning
This repository contains an implementation of a Linear Programming-based offline Inverse Reinforcement Learning algorithm based on the paper "A Unified Linear Programming Framework for Offline Reward Learning".
Overview
Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) aims to recover a reward function from expert demonstrations in a Markov Decision Process (MDP) environment. This implementation uses a linear programming approach to solve the IRL problem in an offline setting.
